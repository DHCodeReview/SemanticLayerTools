Utility functions for visualizations
====================================

The usage of some of these methods requires installing the package with
the extra requirements for text embedding and clustering

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   pip install semanticlayertools[embeddml]


Representing temporal cluster evolution with a streamgraph
**********************************************************

This utility function is meant to support the visualization of calculated
temporal clusters. Parameters to vary are the smoothing (bool) and the minimal
cluster size to consider (default=1000).

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   streamgraph(file, smooth, minClusterSize)


Embedding a text corpus in 2 dimensions
***************************************

Meant to be used to visualize a corpus on 2D by embedding a text column using
the SentenceTransformer approach of SBERT and UMAP. Time consuming method!

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   embeddedTextPlotting(infolderpath, columnName, outpath, umapNeighors)

    `SBERT docs <https://www.sbert.net/index.html>`_
    `UMAP docs <https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_


Clustering texts using SentenceEmbedding
****************************************

Similar to the above method but extended to help finding large scale structures
of a given text corpus. Similar to topic modelling, in addition makes use of
HDBSCAN clustering. Reuses previously generated embedding of corpus.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   embeddedTextClustering(
       infolderpath, columnName, embeddingspath, outpath,
       umapNeighors, umapComponents, hdbscanMinCluster
   )
